Ninapro is a publicly available multimodal database aimed at fostering machine learning research on human, robotic & prosthetic hands.
The 10 Ninapro datasets include a total of over 180 data acquisitions from intact subjects and transradial hand amputees (including electromyography, kinematic, inertial, clinical, neurocognitive and eye-hand coordination data).
The datasets are accessible using the links in the table below and are thoroughly described in the linked open access scientific papers.
Please, cite the corresponding article when using the datasets.

We hope that you will enjoy Ninapro.
